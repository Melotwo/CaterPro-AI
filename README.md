## 🚀 Deploying Your Application

You have two excellent, free options for deploying this application. Netlify is often simpler for frontend projects, while Firebase Hosting is also a powerful choice.

---

### Option 1: Deploying to Netlify (Recommended)

Follow these steps to deploy your site in minutes.

**Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub**
- Make sure your latest code is pushed to your GitHub repository.

**Step 2: Create a Netlify Account**
- Sign up for a free account at [netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com/) using your GitHub account.

**Step 3: Create a New Site**
1.  Log in to Netlify and go to your **Sites** dashboard.
2.  Click **Add new site** > **Import an existing project**.
3.  Connect to **GitHub** and authorize Netlify.
4.  Choose your `CaterPro-AI` repository.
5.  Netlify should automatically detect your build settings. Verify they are correct:
    *   **Build command:** `npm run build`
    *   **Publish directory:** `dist`
6.  Click **Deploy site**. Your first deployment will likely fail because the API key is missing. **This is expected.**

**Step 4: Add Your API Key (Crucial Step)**
1.  After the site is created, go to **Site configuration** > **Build & deploy** > **Environment**.
2.  Click **Edit variables** and add a new variable:
    *   **Key:** `API_KEY`
    *   **Value:** Paste your Gemini API Key here.
3.  Click **Save**.

**Step 5: Redeploy the Site**
1.  Go to the **Deploys** tab for your site.
2.  Click **Trigger deploy** > **Deploy site**.
3.  This time, the build will use your API key and should succeed. Your site is now live!

### Option 2: Deploying to Firebase Hosting

This project contains a GitHub Actions workflow to deploy automatically to Firebase when you push to the `main` branch.

**Step 1: Firebase Project Setup**
1.  Create a free account at [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
2.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click **Add project**, and create a new project (e.g., `caterpro-ai`).
3.  Inside your new project, go to the **Hosting** section in the left-hand menu and click **Get started**. Follow the initial prompts. You don't need to run the `firebase` commands locally since our GitHub Action will handle it.

**Step 2: Configure Your GitHub Repository**
1.  **Disable GitHub Pages:** A common issue is a conflict with GitHub Pages. To fix this, go to your GitHub repo's **Settings** > **Pages**. Under "Build and deployment," change the **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **GitHub Actions**. This ensures our custom deployment workflow runs instead.
2.  **Add Repository Secrets:** Your workflow needs two secret keys to deploy. Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
    *   Click **New repository secret** and add your Gemini API key:
        *   Name: `API_KEY`
        *   Value: *Your Gemini API Key*
    *   Click **New repository secret** again and add your Firebase service account key:
        *   Name: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
        *   Value: *Follow the steps below to get this key.*

**How to get your `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` key:**
1.  In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to your project's **Project settings** (click the ⚙️ icon).
2.  Go to the **Service accounts** tab.
3.  Click **Generate new private key**. A JSON file will download.
4.  Open the file, copy the **entire content**, and paste it as the value for the `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` secret in GitHub.

**Step 3: Push & Verify Deployment**
- **Commit and push** your latest changes to the `main` branch.
- Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository. You should see a workflow named **`🚀 Deploy to Firebase Hosting`** start running.
- Once it completes with a green checkmark ✔️, your site is live! You can find the URL in the **Hosting** section of your Firebase Console.
