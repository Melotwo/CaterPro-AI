## Deploying Your App (The Easy, Automated Way!)

This project is set up for **automated deployment**. Don't worry about pasting code into Firebase—that's not how it works! The process is much simpler.

**Here's the magic:** Whenever you push new code to the `main` branch of your GitHub repository, a special process (a "GitHub Action") automatically builds your app and deploys the new version to Firebase Hosting for you.

You only need to do a **one-time setup** to securely connect your GitHub and Firebase projects.

### One-Time Setup: Connecting GitHub and Firebase

You'll create a special key in Firebase and give it to GitHub so it has permission to deploy your site.

**Step 1: Get Your Firebase Service Account Key**

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and select your `caterpro-ai` project.
2.  Click the **Gear icon** ⚙️ next to "Project Overview" (top-left) and select **Project settings**.
3.  Go to the **Service accounts** tab.
4.  Click the **Generate new private key** button. A warning will appear; click **Generate key**.
5.  A JSON file (e.g., `caterpro-ai-firebase-adminsdk-....json`) will download. Keep it safe.

**Step 2: Add the Key to GitHub Secrets**

1.  Open the downloaded JSON file in a text editor and **copy its entire content**.
2.  Go to your project's GitHub repository page.
3.  Click the **Settings** tab.
4.  In the left sidebar, find "Security" -> **Secrets and variables** -> **Actions**.
5.  Click **New repository secret**.
6.  For the **Name**, type exactly: `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`
7.  In the **Secret** box, paste the entire JSON content you copied.
8.  Click **Add secret**.

**Step 3: Push Your Code & Verify Deployment**

You're all set! From now on, every time you push a change to your `main` branch, the deployment will start automatically.

1.  **Push your changes** to the `main` branch on GitHub.
2.  Go to your project's GitHub repository and click the **Actions** tab.
3.  You should see a new workflow running named **`✅ Deploy to Firebase`**.
4.  Wait for it to complete with a green checkmark ✔️.

Once it's successful, your site is live! You can find the URL in the **Hosting** section of your [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/project/caterpro-ai/hosting).
