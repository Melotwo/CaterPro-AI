## 🎨 Customization

### Updating the Founder Photo
The "Founder Story" on the landing page is designed to be personalized.

1.  **Take a photo** (Portrait/Vertical orientation works best).
2.  **Upload it** to the **main page** of this repository.
3.  **That's it!** The system automatically detects your photo (JPG or PNG) and updates the site.

*(Note: It may take 2-3 minutes for the changes to go live).*
